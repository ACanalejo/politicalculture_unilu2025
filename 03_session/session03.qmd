# Introduction

## Let's play a game!

## So what happened here?

![](mistery_box.png){fig-align="center"}

## What do you think would occur if we make this game...


<br>

. . .

...in a very small and tight rural community?

<br>

. . .

...among a group of left-wing activists?

<br>

. . .

...in your country?

## The program for this session

<br>

Two crucial elements to understand the role of culture in politics:

  1. **Social norms**

  2. **Social identity**

# Social norms

---

**Collective behavior**: behavioral patterns shared by a group of individuals

  1. *Independent*: purely determined by individual reasons (natural or economics)
  
  2. *Interdependent*: influenced by other people's actions or opinions (factual or inferred)

. . .

> "Habits, social customs, and moral injunctions are independent, in the sense that they involve undertaking certain actions regardless of what others do or expect us to do." [@bicchieri_norms_2016]

---

**Preferences**: dispositions to act in a particular way in a specific situation.

> "...in a choice situation, if I choose A over B it must be the case that, all things considered, I prefer A. Preference and choice are thus strictly connected." [@bicchieri_norms_2016]

. . .

[Preferences &ne; attitudes]{style="color:red;"}

. . .

**Attitudes**: evaluative belief toward some object, person or behavior.

- *Prudential* (rational) or *moral* (ethical) motivations

---

**Social preferences** take into account others' behavior, beliefs and outcomes.They are **unconditional** if not influenced by *expectations* about others' beliefs or behavior, and [**conditional**]{style="color:red;"} otherwise.

. . .

<br>

**Interdependent actions** always involve *socially conditional preferences*.

- **(Social) Expectations**: *factual* or *normative* beliefs about others.

## More bolts and nuts

- **Custom**: a pattern of behavior such that individuals (unconditionally) prefer to conform to it because it meets their needs [(e.g., using an umbrella when it rains)]{style="color:grey;"}.

- **Reference network**: the range of people whom we care about when making particular decisions [(i.e., we do not care about everyone's beliefs!)]{style="color:grey;"}.

- **Descriptive norm**: a pattern of behavior such that individuals prefer to conform to it on condition that they believe that most people in their reference network conform to it (*empirical expectation*).

---

![](sopranos.png){fig-align="center"}

## Imitation and coordination

- With **imitation**, those I imitate do not expect me to behave like they do and may not even know they are being imitated, so my expectations are [unilateral]{style="color:red;"} [(e.g., fashion)]{style="color:grey;"}.

  + *Informational* and/or *normative* motivations

- The **coordination** motive is very different from imitation, in that expectations are [multilateral]{style="color:red;"} and stem from a desire to harmonize our actions with those of others so that each of our individual goals can be achieved.

  + Importance of *signals* [(e.g., language, traffic lights)]{style="color:grey;"}

---

A preference for following a **descriptive norm** may involve both *informational* and *normative* influences, or the wish to *coordinate* with others, but this preference remains conditional on ***empirical expectations alone***. 

. . .

<br>

This means that ***if these expectations were to change, preferences and behavior would change too***. There is a [causal relationship]{style="color:red;"} between expectations, preferences, and behavior (as opposed to *customs*).

## Social norms (injuctive norms)

. . .

A [rule of behavior]{style="color:red;"} such that individuals prefer to conform to it on condition that **they believe that (a) most people in their reference network conform to it** (*empirical expectation*), and **(b) that most people in their reference network believe they ought to conform to it** (*normative expectation*).

. . .

- The *ought* must be **moral**, not *prudential*.

- A **deviation** (*non-conformity*) to the norm is expected to end up in a **sanction**.

## Compliance

. . .

<br>

Two factors:

  1. **Seriousness of the sanction** (as a function of the *centrality* or *salience* of the norm to social life)
  
  2. **Sensitivity to the norm** (as a function of the *invididual personal beliefs*)

## Origins and transmission

- **Coordination to achieve collective goals** or **simple descriptive norms** that develop [symbolic meaning]{style="color:red;"} with time [@cialdini2004social]

  + Prosocial orientation in origins
  
    + Fostering trust & reciprocity
  
  + They can become *maladaptive* as time passes (*sticky*)

## The pluralistic ignorance trap

- **Preference falsification**: *true* and *revealed* preferences may not coincide due to *social norms* [@kuran1987preference]

. . .

- **Pluralistic ignorance**: a cognitive state in which each member of a group believes her [*personal normative beliefs and preferences are different*]{style="color:red;"} from those of similarly situated others, even if [*public behavior is identical*]{style="color:red;"}.

## What are the major implications of this theory of social norms?

. . .

- Social norms can lead to **good or bad equilibria** [@valentim2023social]

- Changing attitudes is not enough to **change behavior**:

  + Change [**reference group**]{style="color:red;"}
  
  + Change perceptions of the reference group
  
    1. Empirical 
    
    2. Normative

# Social identity

## What is identity?

. . .

<br>

"A person sense of one's self" [@akerlof2000economics]

![](mirror.png){fig-align="center" fig-align="center" width=600 height=400}

## Inter-group behaviour

"Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, *collectively* or *individually*, with another group or its members **in terms of group identification**, we have an instance of inter-group behavior" [@tajfel1982social]

. . .

- Every individual pertains to a series of **social groups**

- However, not every *social ascription* turns into **social identity**

[Group membership &ne; group identification]{style="color:red;"}

## What is social identity?

<br>

. . .

“Self awareness of one’s **objective membership** in the group and a **psychological sense of attachment** to the group” [@conover1984influence]

<br>

...so that it is *part of* ***a person sense of one’s self***

## From group membership to identity

<br>

- **Cognitive motivations**: need for *self-categorization* [@turner1987rediscovering]

  + [Similarity]{style="color:red;"} (*stereotypes*)
  
  + [Salience]{style="color:red;"} of categories

- **Psychological motivations**: need for consistency and positive self-esteem [@tajfel1979integrative]

  + [Group status]{style="color:red;"} (*social comparison*)

## Challenges [@huddy2001social]

<br>

- Acquired vs ascribed identities (*individual and group differences*)

- Boundary vs meaning (*group heterogeneity*)

- Shades of group identity

- Identity stability (*lab vs real world*)

## The consequences of social identity

[Conflict theory]{style="color:red;"} (i.e., *minimal intergroup situation*):

- **In-group bias** or favoritism

- **Out-group discrimination** and prejudice

. . .

[Contact theory]{style="color:red;"} conditions:

1. Equal group status

2. Common goals

3. Intergroup cooperation

4. Authority support

# Conclusion

## The interplay of social norms and social identity...

<br>

![](person_question.png){fig-align="center"}

## Some theoretical expectations...

- Norms acquire **symbolic meaning** as a **method for social distinctiveness**

- More **tight-knitted social** groups impose **stronger social norms** as social pressure increase

- Since norms vary across groups, they **change** with **social identity change**

- **Inter-group competition** leads to **social norms' reinforcement**

...etc.
