# Introduction

## About me

-   Postdoctoral researcher at the project [DIGIPOL](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/research/digitalization-and-political-conflict-parties-voters-and-electoral-alignment-digipol/#section=c122045) and Senior Researcher the **Chair of Political Behaviour and Communication**

-   PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home)

-   Interested in **political behaviour**, **comparative politics** and **quantitative methods**

-   Originally from the [city with the most UNESCO heritage sites in the world](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/cordoba-spain-has-most-unesco-world-heritage-sites)

-   More in [my personal website](https://acanalejo.github.io/)

## Let's start with a quick quiz!

## And let's meet each other!

## Politics and culture

<br>

-   What do you understand by **politics**?

-   What do you understand by **political behavior**?

. . .

-   What do you understand by [**culture**]{style="color:red;"}?

## Why culture?

<br>

**Traditional approaches** to political behavior has focused on:

  1. Institutions and rationality *(rational choice)*
  
  2. Socio-demographic factors *(sociological approach)*
  
  3. Psychology and cognition *(psychological approach)*

. . .

[**Culture**]{style="color:red;"}, despite admittedly *pervasive*, has been largely ignored in **empirical political science** until recently

## The stronger presence of culture in political science

  1.  New **methods** (i.e., identification revolution and machine learning)

  2.  More **data** (i.e., digitalization of large corpora of text, including archival data)

##

  1.  New **methods** (i.e., identification revolution and machine learning)

  2.  More **data** (i.e., digitalization of large corpora of text, including archival data)
  
  3.  **Historical turn** of empirical social science (e.g., origins, persistence, "stickiness")

## The stronger presence of culture in political science

  1.  New **methods** (i.e., identification revolution and machine learning)

  2.  More **data** (i.e., digitalization of large corpora of text, including archival data)
  
  3.  **Historical turn** of empirical social science (e.g., origins, persistence, "stickiness")

  4.  **Failing answers** (e.g., external validity concerns, replication crisis)

## The WEIRD realization

<br>

. . .

***Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD)*** societies

-   Replication crisis in psychology and the social sciences unveiled

-   Influential paper: Henrich et al [-@henrich_weirdest_2010]

## What WEIRD differences do Henrich et al find?

. . .

- **Visual perception** (large vs small scale societies)

- **Fairness and cooperation in decision-making** (large vs small scale societies)

- **Anti-social punishment** (Western vs "non-western" societies)

- **Individualism** (contemporary US vs. the rest of the world)

Etc.

## Culture as an overlooked dimension to unpack

Culture in modern **political science** is undergoing a process of:

  1. Conceptualization
  
  2. Theorization
    
  3. Operationalization

. . .

# The course organization

## Schedule I

<br>

**Block I.** 28.02.25 / 9:15–17:00

- Introduction to culture and politics: social norms, social identity, cultural origins, transmission and persistence

**Block II.** 21.03.25 / 9:15–15:30

- Political behaviour topics I: vote choice, turnout, attitudes toward minorities

## Schedule II

<br>

**Block III.** 11.04.25 / 9:15–17:00

**Block IV.** 24.05.25 / 9:15–17:00

- Presentations: *mini-conference*!

## Teaching policy

-   This course is a **mixed** between a seminar and a lecture

-   Thus, I expect you to have read the **mandatory readings** and to **participate**

-   I will introduce the topic and guide the discussion, but you should actively pursue the **debate**

. . .

-   The main drivers of the debate will be the readings, but we can (will) deviate from them, the goal is to develop **critical thinking**!

## Course requirements

- Only English as a formal requirements

- Knowledge of **quantitative methods** is **recommended**

- Knowledge of political science is an asset

![](disclaimer.png){fig-align="center" fig-align="center" width=500 height=250}

## Integration and interaction policy

<br>

-   Equal participation will be actively promoted

-   Please use gender neutral language whenever possible

-   **Discrimination or bullying of any type is** [***strictly forbidden***]{style="color:red;"}

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy

<br>

- AI use is permitted

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align = "center"}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Data for grading policy
grades <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Participation","Response papers", "Research proposal", "Presentation", "Discussion"),
  Percentage = c(10, 20, 30, 30, 10)
)

# Reorder the levels of Category based on Percentage from higher to lower
grades$Category <- factor(grades$Category, levels = grades$Category[order(-grades$Percentage)])

# Create a bar chart
ggplot(grades, aes(x = reorder(Category, -Percentage), y = Percentage, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Percentage, "%")), vjust = -0.5) +  # Add percentage labels
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Grading Policy Breakdown", x = "Category", y = "Percentage") +  # Remove x-axis label
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  ylim(0,50) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",  # Add legend for categories
        legend.title = element_blank(),  # Remove legend title
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove x-axis text
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  # Center title
